Bellabeat Leaf Bracelet Case Study
---

## Introduction and background
In this case study, I will perform data analysis for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I was tasked to analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers use their smart devices and provide insights on how to improve the features offered on their devices. 

### Area of focus
I chose to focus on the Leaf bracelet, which is jewlery that doubles as a wellness tracker that collects information such as: fitness activity, sleep habits, and menstrual cycles. 

### Data integrity
The data presented was generated by respondents (on a Fitbit) to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences. This dataset was pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) and was made available through Mobius.

The original data source can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.Y7nl-XbMK01).The metadata confirms it is open-source. The owner has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. The data can be copied, modified, distributed without asking permission.

## Dataset
There are 18 different CSV files included in the dataset. We have uploaded two CSVs into the project, but you will likely want to use more than just these two CSV files.

## Installing and loading common packages and libraries
You can always install and load packages along the way as you may discover you need different packages after you start your analysis. If you already have some of these packages installed and loaded, you can skip those ones - or you can choose to run those specific lines of code anyway. It may take a few moments to run.

```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```
